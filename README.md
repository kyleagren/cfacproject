This was a project made as an application to a Web Developer position at BYU. 

I was trying to look for ways to write my own JavaScript since I enjoy that more than HTML / CSS but for the requirements of the challenge,
I couldn't quite find productive ways to do so. My goal was to fill the requirements and make it look fairly nice but also not invest too much time 
into fluff due to other obligations.
